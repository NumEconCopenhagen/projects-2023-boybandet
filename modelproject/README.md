# Model analysis project

Our project is titled **OLG model project** and is about an OLG model where we analytically find SS-value for capital. The model is also solved numerically where we analyze how the model change when different variables and parameters are adjusted.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [OLGJ upyter.ipynb](OLGJupyter.ipynb) . Do also run the [Modelproject2.py](Modelproject2.py) file.

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
