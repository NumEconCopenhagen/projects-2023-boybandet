# Inaugural project

The project seeks to analyse the **Household maximization problem** from working from home, between two genders **male** and **female**.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [inauguralproject.ipynb](inauguralproject.ipynb). Do also run the [inauguralproject.py](inauguralproject.py) file and the [question5.py](question5.py) file.

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
