# Exam project

This is our solution to the 2023 exam in Introduction to programming and numerical analysis at the University of Copenhagen.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [examproject.ipynb](examproject.ipynb) . Note that no .py file is included in this repository, as the project is entirely done in Jupyter Notebook due to coding preferences.

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
